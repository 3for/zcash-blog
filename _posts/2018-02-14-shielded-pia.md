<a href="https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/">Private Internet Access</a> has added support for shielded addresses! Private Internet Access protects your privacy by encrypting your connection and providing an alternate IP address to browse the web.

You can now use your favorite privacy-preserving cryptocurrency to purchase a privacy-enhancing service.

<h3>Purchasing process</h3>

To purchase their services via a Zcash shielded transaction, ensure that your wallet supports shielded transactions. There is a community maintained list of them <a href="https://www.zcashcommunity.com/wallets/">here</a>. Once you have your wallet set up and funded, head over to <a href="http://www.privateinternetaccess.com">www.privateinternetaccess.com</a> and choose the plan you wish to purchase.

As your payment method, choose to pay with ZEC by clicking the button that says “pay anonymously with our Zcash z-address” option.

You’ll need to enter in an email as a part of the purchase. If you don’t feel comfortable with providing your real email, use a temporary email services like <a href="http://dispostable.com/">dispostable</a>, <a href="http://www.fakeinbox.com/">fakeinbox</a>, or <a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/">guerillamail</a>. Make sure you are able to access the inbox, since that’s where they send credentials.

We have updated our <a href="https://z.cash/support/ux-checklist.html">checklist of good UX practices</a> with specific advice on handling Zcash features. Our intent is to provide Zcash wallet developers with guidance on making design decisions and catch common usability problems.

[caption id="attachment_2731" align="aligncenter" width="232"]<a href="https://z.cash/static/zcash-ux-checklist-20180118.pdf"><img class="wp-image-2731 size-medium" src="https://blog.z.cash/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/zcash-ux-checklist-20180410-thumb-232x300.png" alt="UX Checklist" width="232" height="300" /></a> UX Checklist for Wallet Developers[/caption]

The updated content addresses how to: 
<ul>
 	<li>Support transparent and shielded addresses</li>
 	<li>Set various transaction parameters</li>
 	<li>Use viewing keys for selective disclosure</li>
 	<li>Use memo fields for bookkeeping </li>
</ul>
We believe that improving the user experience for wallets will be a huge step in making cryptocurrencies accessible. Zcash provides a Linux <a href="https://z.cash/download.html">client</a> but has not released an official wallet. A community maintained list of Zcash wallets is <a href="https://www.zcashcommunity.com/wallets/">here</a>.

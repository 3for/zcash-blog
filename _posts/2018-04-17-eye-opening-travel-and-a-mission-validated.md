<span style="font-weight: 400;">We see momentum everywhere. We see our beliefs — that everyone has a right to privacy, that the pursuit of economic freedom is virtuous, that the future of money is an attack- and censorship-resistant cryptocurrency — being shared in communities all over the world by more and more people.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">And we are inspired by the ideas and ideals — and the challenges — this movement is bringing forth.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Zooko witnessed this groundswell on trips to India and Singapore earlier this month, where he met with developers, privacy advocates, students, journalists and policy makers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Bangalore, he was introduced to reporters from </span><a href="http://www.thehindu.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the Hindu</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Economic Times</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and met the IT Minister of </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Karnataka"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karnataka</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to provide inputs on the state’s blockchain roadmap. He met the founders of several Indian crypto exchanges (</span><a href="https://www.coinome.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Coinome</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.unocoin.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unocoin</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://coinswitch.co/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CoinSwitch</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), briefed </span><a href="https://www.sequoiacap.com/india/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sequoia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> portfolio companies, and participated in a fireside panel hosted by </span><a href="https://www.accel.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Accel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that included more than 50 leading investors, tech operators and senior professionals in the Bangalore ecosystem. In Chennai, he attended a dinner with 30 key blockchain and technology experts and met with Dr. Pandu Rangan, the Head of Cryptography at IIT-Madras to discuss the latest developments with Zcash.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In Singapore, Zooko presented at </span><a href="https://www.decentralize.sg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">De/Centralize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a blockchain conference “examining the thematic interplay of decentralization and centralization in technology, economics and law,” </span><a href="https://twitter.com/zibin/status/983272126667833344"><span style="font-weight: 400;">forged a few new relationships with companies like Pundix</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, met with a number of top officials of the Singapore government, and he helped lead deep-dive blockchain training at the </span><a href="http://www.suss.edu.sg/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Singapore University of Social Sciences</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The point of this brief post isn’t to provide a moment-by-moment itinerary of Zooko’s travels. But we point out some highlights because we were reminded that this movement we’re a part of is no small thing. We are encouraged and humbled, and our beliefs in freedom and economic opportunity are bolstered.</span>

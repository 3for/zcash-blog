Yesterday Goldman Sachs-backed <a href="https://blog.circle.com/2018/04/30/circle-invest-welcomes-zcash/">Circle announced</a> its support for Zcash in <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/invest">Circle Invest</a>. Zcash joins Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin. 

Circle’s mission is to “democratize access to investing in crypto assets for every consumer.” It<a href="https://www.coindesk.com/circle-granted-first-bitlicense-rebrands-as-circle-pay/"> was the first company to receive a BitLicense</a> from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and announced the availability of <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-opens-crypto-investment-app-to-46-us-states-leverages-bitlicense-to-enter-new-york">Circle Invest to US Citizens in 46 states earlier this year</a>. It is also now available to investors in New York. 

In the post, Circle indicates that it will be making a series of announcements over the “next 3 weeks.” Senior product manager <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/circle-adds-zcash-crypto-investment-app/">Rachel Mayer told Coindesk</a>, "Circle has an established working group dedicated to finding the best crypto assets for our customers.” 

We obviously agree that they made a good first choice.

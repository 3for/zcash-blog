<span style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday Goldman Sachs-backed </span><a href="https://blog.circle.com/2018/04/30/circle-invest-welcomes-zcash/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circle announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> its support for Zcash in </span><a href="https://www.circle.com/en/invest"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circle Invest</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Zcash joins Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Litecoin. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Circle’s mission is to “democratize access to investing in crypto assets for every consumer.” It</span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/circle-granted-first-bitlicense-rebrands-as-circle-pay/"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was the first company to receive a BitLicense</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and announced the availability of </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/circle-opens-crypto-investment-app-to-46-us-states-leverages-bitlicense-to-enter-new-york"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Circle Invest to US Citizens in 46 states earlier this year</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is also now available to investors in New York. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the post, Circle indicates that it will be making a series of announcements over the “next 3 weeks.” Senior product manager </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/circle-adds-zcash-crypto-investment-app/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rachel Mayer told Coindesk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, "Circle has an established working group dedicated to finding the best crypto assets for our customers.” </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We obviously agree that they made a good first choice.</span>

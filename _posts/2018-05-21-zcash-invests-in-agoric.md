Today we are announcing our investment in <a href="https://agoric.com/">Agoric</a>.

Founded by pioneers in the world of secure development and distributed systems, Agoric will provide an open, standards-based object-capability (OCAP) programming layer aligned to ECMAScript (JavaScript) standards. This will allow the world’s estimated 20 million JavaScript developers to build highly secure, decentralized and robust applications (DApps) against a number of blockchains. 

The <a href="https://agoric.com/team/">exceptional team at Agoric</a> includes Mark S. Miller, E. Dean Tribble, Brian Warner, and Bill Tulloh. Zooko Wilcox, CEO of Zcash Company said, “This founding team are pioneers of some of the fundamental science of secure programming and distributed systems. And, some of them are my personal friends and mentors who have been among the biggest influences on my scientific career.”

We believe that people will increasingly demand access to secure, decentralized applications; that money will be programmable; that contracts will cross legal jurisdictions; and that all of this must be secure. We are excited to be a part of the Agoric mission.

The Agoric announcement is available <a href="https://agoric.com/2018/05/21/introduction.html">here</a>. This morning, <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/new-startup-zooko-naval-betting-better-crypto-contracts/">Coindesk also profiled the company and team</a>.

This marks the second investment by Zcash Company. <a href="https://blog.z.cash/zcash-invests-in-starkware/">Previously, we announced an investment in StarkWare Industries</a>. The Zcash Company does not actively seek investment opportunities and is not currently evaluating any other investments. These projects were chosen because of their world-class teams, deep scientific and engineering depth, and because they are working on innovations which may prove to be strategically important for our mission of empowering everyone with economic freedom and opportunity.
